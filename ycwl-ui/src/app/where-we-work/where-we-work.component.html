                Gbarpolu is in the northwestern region of Liberia, bordering Sierra Leone to the west. It was
                established
                as a county in 2001 when it was created from parts of Lofa and Bong counties. Bopolu serves as the
                administrative and political center of Gbarpolu County. As per the 2022 Population Census, Gbarpolu has
                a
                population of over 95, 995 residents. The economy of Gbarpolu is primarily farming, with agriculture
                being a
                significant source of livelihood for most of the population. Farming activities include the cultivation
                of
                crops such as rice, cassava, and other subsistence crops.
              </p>
              <p>
                The county has seen efforts to improve infrastructure, including roads and basic services, to enhance
                connectivity and the overall quality of life for its residents. Like in other parts of Liberia, access
                to
                education and healthcare services is crucial for the well-being of the population. Efforts are made to
                improve these social services in the county.

                      With financial support from the UN Peacebuilding Fund office through UNDP Liberia, Youth Crime Watch of Liberia successfully implemented a nine-month project titled "Enhancing a Peaceful Electoral Environment and Community Security" across five counties including Gbarpolu, with a specific focus on key locations such as Medina Town, Bopolu City, and Compoundsu Town in Gbarpolu. The overall objective of this project was to strengthen the capacities of various stakeholders, including 100 joint securities, 225 community watch teams, representatives from political parties, and local authorities. The Project team successfully collaborated with key partners including the Liberia Peace Building Office, the National Election Commission, the Independent National Human Rights Commission, the Liberian National Police, and the Ministry of Justice. The primary focus of the project was to foster a peaceful electoral environment by implementing targeted interventions in conflict prevention and addressing the potential escalation of insecurity, human rights violations, and electoral violence leading up to, during, and after the 2023 General Elections in Liberia.

                    <p>
                      A key component of the project involved enhancing policy reforms and reinforcing existing Early Warning and Response (EWER) mechanisms. This included mainstreaming human rights, gender, and youth-based approaches, particularly at the grassroots level. The project played a vital role in supporting responses to both actual and perceived triggers of electoral violence by integrating a diverse range of actors into the Early Warning and Response mechanism.

                      In terms of beneficiaries, the project had a significant impact on over 1,500 direct and indirect recipients, including joint securities, community watch teams, political party representatives, and local authorities. Through a complete and joint approach, the Project effectively contributed to creating an environment conducive to the just-ended peaceful elections, while simultaneously addressing potential challenges related to insecurity and electoral violence. The success of the project underscores the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships in promoting sustainable peace and security within the context of democratic processes.

                      With funding support from the UN Peacebuilding Fund office through UNDP Liberia, Youth Crime Watch of Liberia successfully implemented a nine-month project titled "Enhancing a Peaceful Electoral Environment and Community Security" across five counties including Rivercess County, with a specific focus on key locations such as Owensgrove, Buchanan City, and Compound-one in Grand Bassa County. The overall objective of this project was to strengthen the capacities of various stakeholders, including 100 joint securities, 225 community watch teams, representatives from political parties, and local authorities. The Project team successfully collaborated with key partners including the Liberia Peace Building Office, the National Election Commission, the Independent National Human Rights Commission, the Liberian National Police, and the Ministry of Justice. The primary focus of the project was to foster a peaceful electoral environment by implementing targeted interventions in conflict prevention and addressing the potential escalation of insecurity, human rights violations, and electoral violence leading up to, during, and after the 2023 General Elections in Liberia. A key component of the project involved enhancing policy reforms and reinforcing existing Early Warning and Response (EWER) mechanisms. This included mainstreaming human rights, gender, and youth-based approaches, particularly at the grassroots level. The project played a vital role in supporting responses to both actual and perceived triggers of electoral violence by integrating a diverse range of actors into the Early Warning and Response mechanism.

                      In terms of beneficiaries, the project had a significant impact on over 1,500 direct and indirect recipients, including joint securities, community watch teams, political party representatives, and local authorities. Through a complete and joint approach, the Project effectively contributed to creating an environment conducive to the just-ended peaceful elections, while simultaneously addressing potential challenges related to insecurity and electoral violence. The success of the project underscores the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships in promoting sustainable peace and security within the context of democratic processes.

                      A One-day celebration in commemoration of the United Nations Climate Change Day:  In 2015, YOUTH CRIME WATCH OF LIBERIA Collaborated with local CSOs in Montserrado County to celebrate the United Nations Climate Change Day under the THEME “SEAL THE DEAL”. The program brought about 100 young people from around communities in Montserrado County to parade, and advocate for climate change, and to further ensure that Liberia has a huge representation at the COP 15. During the event, Miss Georgette Sithole presented the position statement on behalf of the organization to representatives from the UN, and other National and Government line institutions attending. The position statement centered around humans' unwillingness to recognize the effects of greenhouse gases and the challenges youth, politicians, business organizations, environmental groups, and the United Nations to make good decisions.  COP 15 meeting is considered a gateway to the future, and anything less than an agreement would have greater consequences on the lives of young people, especially the poor ones. One of the most interesting activities at the program was the stamping of the Global Petition as per the United Nations campaign activities. After the petition, a lot of young people were supported to attend the COP Program and are still applying.

                      Youth Crime Watch of Liberia secured grant support from giz│Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, a Public-Private-Partnership fund, in partnership with Green Cities Liberia to implement activities under the Reduction, Reuse, and Recycling of Waste Using a Municipal Solid Waste Management Approach that Promotes Employment project. The project significantly impacts the economy by promoting sustainable employment opportunities and entrepreneurship, as well as improving the environment and public health. The project contributes to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting sustainable consumption and production and reducing waste. With glaring tangibles of increased social gaps post-war Liberia experiences, unemployment, and sanitation a real challenges Liberia as a country faces. High unemployment rates are still a matter of serious concern for development practitioners both internationally and nationally. In 2021-2022, Trading Economics Global Macro Models and Analysts predicted Liberia's unemployment rate was expected to reach 4.10% by the closure of 2022 to early 2023. In the long-term, the Liberia Unemployment Rate is projected to trend around 4.20 percent in 2023, according to our econometric models. Besides, the city of Monrovia has experienced a huge increase in waste generation over the years due to rapid urbanization, an increase in population, changes in consumption patterns, etc. (Country Situational Analysis, 2011). Approximately 33.3 percent of all Liberians live in Monrovia. (Country Situational Analysis, 2011). (UN data, 2017). The situation in the city is further worsened by a lack of adequate technological, technical financial, and human resources capacity (UNEP, 2006). TVET institutions have successfully gained aided entry into work programs and qualifying people for work. However, new, and innovative strategies to address unemployment still need to be explored, such as using waste management as an employment solution. This Project will help with the reduction, reuse, and recycling of waste using a municipal solid waste management approach that promotes employment projects and is expected to significantly impact the economy by promoting sustainable employment opportunities and entrepreneurship, as well as improving the environment and public health. The project will also contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by promoting sustainable consumption and production and reducing waste. The Project targets 150 beneficiaries in and around Montserrado County, Liberia.
