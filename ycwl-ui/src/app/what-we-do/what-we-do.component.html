                While education in Liberia is theoretically free for students attending government schools,
                most of these institutions suffer from inadequate learning facilities. Consequently, many
                parents opt to send their children to private schools, which often come with a hefty price
                tag that is beyond the means of the average Liberian family. The 14-year civil war, followed
                by the 2014 Ebola outbreak that led to school closures, had a profound and enduring impact on
                the education system.

                In most communities in Liberia, especially rural areas, the populations have limited
                opportunities for civic engagement due to geographical isolation and lower levels of
                education, affecting their participation in key decision-making processes. Youth Crime

                Gender discrimination and deeply ingrained social norms have disproportionate effects on
                males and females, subjecting them to distinct challenges. Specifically, females often find
                themselves at risk of child marriage, teenage pregnancy, child labor, limited access to
                quality education and healthcare, sexual abuse, exploitation, and various forms of violence.
                In contrast, males can also fall victim to issues such as sodomy, mental abuse, stigmatization,
                bullying, domestic violence, and sexual abuse.

                Liberia is a nation characterized by its youthful population, with a significant demographic imbalance.
                An astonishing 42 percent of the population is comprised of children under the age of 15, and a staggering
                63 percent are under the age of 25. This demographic makeup presents Liberia with a formidable challenge:
                to safeguard its young citizens from harm while concurrently providing them with the space and opportunities
                to develop and lead the country toward a brighter future.
